# Archive

This directory contains documentation files that have been superseded by the new documentation structure in [docs/](../docs/).

## Archived Files

- **NOTES.md**: Scratch notes and code snippets (now tracked in Beads or documented in [docs/](../docs/))
- **TASKS.md**: Old task tracking (now managed via Beads issue tracking)
- **README_BACKUP.md**: Previous README version (replaced by current [README.md](../README.md))

These files are kept for historical reference but should not be used for current development.
