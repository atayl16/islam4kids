- Comments system
- User profiles
- Newsletter signup
- Social sharing
- Analytics
- Model specs for image attachment validations

## How to Use This List

1. **Pick the next unchecked task**
2. **Implement it yourself**
3. **Run tests** (`just test` and `just lint`)
4. **Check the box** when done
5. **Ask Claude to review** ("I finished task #X, please review")
6. **Make any improvements** Claude suggests
7. **Move to next task**

## Quick Commands

```bash
bin/dev                      # Start Rails + Tailwind watcher (recommended)
just test                    # Run all tests
just lint                    # Run RuboCop
dev scans                    # Security scan
rails c                      # Open console
rails db:migrate             # Run migrations
rails db:seed                # Seed database
rails db:reset               # Drop, create, migrate, seed (fresh start)
```

## Notes

- **Phase 2 features** (categories, featured content, etc.) are documented but deferred until after MVP launch
- **Phase 1E+** (caching) comes AFTER everything works and is tested
- Test incrementally as you build features (don't wait until the end)
- Active Storage will need S3 for Heroku deployment
- Remember to run `bin/dev` instead of `rails s` to compile Tailwind CSS

---

**Current Status:** Phase 1E Complete âœ… - Tests, linting, and security scans passing!
**Next Up:** Phase 1E+ - Caching ðŸš€
**Tasks Remaining:** 17 tasks to MVP deployment (39 deferred, 42-44, 48 skipped)

**Recent Progress:**
- Confirmed test suite is green (`just test` passing)
- Linting clean (`just lint` passing)
- Security scans passing (`dev scans` clean)
- Testing has been done incrementally throughout development
- AWS S3 setup deferred until deployment preparation
